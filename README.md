# Cloak - Decentralized & Encrypted Chat Platform  

Cloak is a **secure, decentralized chat application** designed to ensure **privacy, anonymity, and security** in online communication. It leverages **blockchain authentication** and **end-to-end encryption**, combined with a **Tor-like routing system**, to provide a censorship-resistant and private messaging experience.  
Hello world
## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Blockchain-Based Authentication**: Users authenticate using their **Ethereum wallet** (MetaMask).  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.  
- **Decentralized Communication**: WebSockets handle real-time messaging over a distributed network.  
- **Tor-Like Routing**: Messages are relayed through multiple nodes to enhance privacy.  
- **Censorship-Resistant**: No central authority can shut down or control communication.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: React (Next.js)  
- **Backend**: Bun / Node.js with WebSockets  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts (Solidity)  
- **Encryption**: AES / RSA hybrid encryption for secure messaging  
- **Routing**: Custom Tor-like node relays  

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap  

- [ ] Implement secure WebSocket messaging  
- [ ] Deploy Ethereum smart contracts for authentication  
- [ ] Build a peer-to-peer node relay system  
- [ ] Develop a polished UI for seamless UX  

## ðŸ’¡ Why Cloak?  

Traditional messaging apps collect user data, track activity, and can be censored. **Cloak** ensures absolute privacy by combining **decentralization, encryption, and anonymous routing**, making it a truly **private and secure communication platform**.
